Listviews

jQuery Mobile includes a diverse set of common listviews that are coded as lists with a data-role="listview" added. Here is a simple linked list that has a role of listview. We're going to make this look like an inset module by adding a data-inset="true" attribute and we add a dynamic search filter with data-filter="true" and a text field.
